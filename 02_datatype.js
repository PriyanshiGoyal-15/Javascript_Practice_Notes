// we use this for newer version of js so we can use of the new upgraded feature of js so the command is :
"use strict";

//alert statement
//alert(3 + 3) 
//it will give error as we are using nodejs not a browser console


//code readability is the good practice
console.log(3 + 3);
console.log("priyanshi")
    /*
    as it will not give error but the code readbility will become difficult in long code so we prefer to write both statement in next line
    */


//some different kind of datatypes 
//example
let name = "priyanshi"
let age = 18
let isLoggedIn = false
let state;

//number 
//boolean [true and false]
//string [in " ..." , '...']
//null [standalone value]
//undefined [where we defined variable but not value]


//we can check the type of variable or any value
console.log(typeof undefined); //undefined
console.log(typeof null); //object
