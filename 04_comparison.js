//we cannot compare 2 different datatype as the answer is unpredictable and not comparable

// as null is empty value
//it is unpredictable as it can be convert in NAN and sometimes in 0

// comparing undefined with value it will return false

// strict check mean where we check "==="triple equal
//it strictly check the value and datatype also
